- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering):** The page is rendered on the server at each request, delivering fully rendered HTML to the client.
- **SSG (Static Site Generation):** The page is pre-rendered at build time, serving static HTML files for fast performance.
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):** Allows static pages to be updated after deployment by re-generating them in the background based on a defined interval or trigger.
